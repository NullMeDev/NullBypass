# Browser Extension Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive security analysis of a browser extension with significant security concerns. The extension exhibits multiple high-risk behaviors including heavily obfuscated code, broad host permissions, credit card data handling capabilities, and potential for malicious activity.

**Overall Risk Assessment: CRITICAL**

## 1. Manifest Analysis

### 1.1 Core Permissions

The manifest.json file requests the following permissions:

- `activeTab` - Access to current active tab
- `scripting` - Code injection capabilities
- `storage` - Local data storage
- `tabs` - Tab information access
- `clipboardRead` / `clipboardWrite` - Clipboard access
- `notifications` - System notification display
- `declarativeNetRequest` - Network request modification

### 1.2 Host Permissions (HIGH RISK)

The extension has broad host access to:
- `*://stripe.com/*` - Payment processing platform
- `*://buy.stripe.com/*` - Stripe checkout platform
- `*://api.telegram.org/*` - Telegram messaging API
- `*://asheo.dev/*` - Unknown third-party domain

**Security Concern**: These permissions allow the extension to intercept, modify, and exfiltrate sensitive payment data from Stripe transactions and potentially communicate with external servers via Telegram API.

### 1.3 Network Request Rules

The extension includes declarativeNetRequest rules that modify headers for Stripe API requests:
- Modifies `Content-Type` headers for `https://api.stripe.com/*`
- This could potentially bypass security checks or alter payment processing behavior

## 2. Code Obfuscation Analysis

### 2.1 Obfuscation Level (CRITICAL RISK)

All primary JavaScript files are heavily obfuscated:
- `background.js` - 200+ lines of obfuscated code
- `inject.js` - Similar obfuscation pattern
- `popup.js` - Obfuscated popup functionality
- `auto.js` - Heavily obfuscated autohitter module
- `hitsender.js` - Obfuscated network communication module

### 2.2 Obfuscation Techniques Identified

1. **Variable Name Scrambling**: All meaningful variable names replaced with random strings
2. **String Encoding**: Text strings encoded using custom base-91 style encoding
3. **Control Flow Obfuscation**: Complex nested function calls and indirect execution
4. **Dead Code Injection**: Unnecessary code to confuse analysis
5. **Function Wrapping**: Multiple layers of function wrappers

### 2.3 Security Implications

The extreme level of obfuscation is a major red flag indicating:
- Intent to hide malicious functionality
- Evasion of security analysis
- Potential violation of browser store policies
- Difficulty in security auditing

## 3. Functional Analysis

### 3.1 Credit Card Related Functionality (HIGH RISK)

Based on popup.html and CSS analysis, the extension appears to handle:
- "Auto Gen / BIN" functionality - Likely credit card BIN (Bank Identification Number) generation
- "Custom CCs" - Custom credit card handling
- Credit card styling and display elements in CSS

**Security Concern**: This suggests the extension may be designed to generate, test, or process credit card numbers, which could facilitate fraud.

### 3.2 Auto-hitting/Automation Features

The extension includes modules for:
- `autohitter` - Automated interaction capabilities
- `hitsender` - Network request automation
- `retry` - Retry logic for failed operations
- `overlay` - UI overlay for automation

**Security Concern**: These features combined with payment site access could enable automated testing of stolen credit card data.

### 3.3 External Communication

Evidence of communication with:
- Stripe payment APIs (direct access)
- Telegram APIs (potential data exfiltration)
- Unknown third-party domains

## 4. Identified Vulnerabilities

### 4.1 Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Credential Harvesting Capability**
   - Direct access to payment forms on Stripe
   - Clipboard access for intercepting copied data
   - Potential keylogging through content script injection

2. **Data Exfiltration Risks**
   - Network request modification capabilities
   - External API communication channels
   - Local storage access for data persistence

3. **Code Injection Attacks**
   - Scripting permissions allow arbitrary code execution
   - Obfuscated code makes detection difficult
   - Active tab access enables form manipulation

### 4.2 High-Risk Behaviors

1. **Payment Processing Interference**
   - Stripe API header modification
   - Form field manipulation capabilities
   - Transaction interception potential

2. **Privacy Violations**
   - Clipboard monitoring
   - Cross-site data access
   - Persistent local storage usage

3. **Automated Fraud Activities**
   - Credit card generation/testing capabilities
   - Automated form submission
   - Retry mechanisms for failed transactions

## 5. Security Recommendations

### 5.1 Immediate Actions Required

1. **REMOVE EXTENSION IMMEDIATELY** - This extension poses significant security risks
2. **Audit Browser Data** - Check for any stored credentials or payment information
3. **Monitor Financial Accounts** - Watch for unauthorized transactions
4. **Change Passwords** - Update passwords for any payment or financial accounts

### 5.2 For Organizations

1. **Block Extension Installation** - Add to enterprise blocklist
2. **Network Monitoring** - Monitor for communications to identified domains
3. **User Education** - Warn users about suspicious extension behaviors
4. **Security Policy Updates** - Implement stricter extension approval processes

### 5.3 Technical Mitigations

1. **Content Security Policy** - Implement strict CSP headers on payment pages
2. **Extension Monitoring** - Deploy tools to monitor extension behavior
3. **Network Segmentation** - Isolate payment processing systems
4. **Regular Security Audits** - Conduct periodic extension security reviews

## 6. Compliance and Legal Concerns

### 6.1 Regulatory Violations

This extension likely violates:
- **PCI DSS** - Unauthorized payment card data handling
- **GDPR** - Data processing without consent
- **Browser Store Policies** - Malicious behavior and obfuscation
- **Anti-Fraud Regulations** - Potential facilitation of financial fraud

### 6.2 Legal Implications

- Potential criminal activity facilitation
- Violation of computer fraud laws
- Privacy regulation breaches
- Financial service regulations

## 7. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

### 7.1 Network Indicators

- Communications to `stripe.com` or `buy.stripe.com` from extension context
- API calls to `api.telegram.org`
- Connections to `asheo.dev`
- Unusual network traffic patterns during payment processing

### 7.2 Behavioral Indicators

- Unexpected clipboard activity
- Automated form submissions
- Unusual browser extension activity
- Modified payment processing behavior

## 8. Conclusion

This browser extension represents a critical security threat with characteristics consistent with malicious payment fraud tools. The combination of:

- Extensive obfuscation to hide functionality
- Broad permissions targeting payment platforms
- Credit card handling capabilities
- Automated interaction features
- External communication channels

Creates a profile consistent with sophisticated financial fraud malware. The extension should be considered malicious and removed immediately from any environment where it's discovered.

### Final Risk Rating: **CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE REMOVAL REQUIRED**
