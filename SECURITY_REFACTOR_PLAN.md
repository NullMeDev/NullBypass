# Security Refactoring Plan

## Critical Security Issues Identified

### 1. Overly Broad Host Permissions
- **Issue**: Extension has access to all URLs including sensitive domains like stripe.com, telegram.org
- **Risk**: Data exfiltration, credit card theft, unauthorized access to user accounts
- **Solution**: Restrict to essential domains only

### 2. Heavily Obfuscated Code
- **Issue**: All JavaScript files use complex obfuscation to hide malicious functionality
- **Risk**: Bypasses security reviews, conceals data theft operations
- **Solution**: Complete deobfuscation and transparent code rewrite

### 3. Automated Form Filling & Submission
- **Issue**: Code automates filling forms with fake addresses, credit card data, and auto-submits
- **Risk**: Credit card fraud, identity theft, unauthorized purchases
- **Solution**: Remove automated form manipulation entirely

### 4. Address Generation and BIN Handling
- **Issue**: Generates fake addresses and handles credit card BINs
- **Risk**: Facilitates fraudulent transactions
- **Solution**: Remove all financial data handling

### 5. Content Script Injection on All Sites
- **Issue**: Content scripts run on every website user visits
- **Risk**: Universal surveillance, data collection from all sites
- **Solution**: Restrict to specific approved domains

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Remove Malicious Components
1. Delete all obfuscated autohitter modules
2. Remove address generation functionality
3. Remove credit card BIN handling
4. Remove automated form submission logic

### Phase 2: Implement Security-First Architecture
1. Minimal permissions principle
2. Transparent, readable code only
3. Content Security Policy implementation
4. Input validation and sanitization

### Phase 3: Rebuild Core Functionality
1. Define legitimate use case for extension
2. Implement only essential features
3. Add comprehensive logging and audit trails
4. Implement user consent mechanisms

## New Architecture Principles

1. **Zero Trust**: No automatic data collection or transmission
2. **Transparency**: All code must be human-readable
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions
4. **User Control**: All actions require explicit user consent
5. **Audit Trail**: All operations must be logged and reviewable

## Implementation Plan

1. Create new manifest with minimal permissions
2. Replace all obfuscated code with clean implementations
3. Implement comprehensive security controls
4. Add user privacy controls and data management
5. Create transparent documentation of all functionality
