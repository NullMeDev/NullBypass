- **No Data Collection**: No personal information is sent to external servers
- **Security Monitoring**: Helps identify potential security issues on websites

### Key Features

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Privacy and Security

#### Q: Does this extension track my browsing?
**A**: No. The extension only monitors activity on explicitly allowed domains (like example.com) and only logs extension-related activities, not general browsing.

#### Q: Is my personal information collected?
**A**: No personal information is collected, stored, or transmitted. The extension only stores user preferences and activity logs locally.

#### Q: Can I use this extension on banking websites?
**A**: The extension only operates on pre-approved domains for security. Banking sites are not included in the default allowed domains.

#### Q: How do I know what data is being stored?
**A**: All stored data can be viewed by exporting audit logs. The extension provides complete transparency about its activities.

### Functionality

#### Q: Why doesn't the extension work on all websites?
**A**: For security and privacy, the extension only operates on explicitly allowed domains. This prevents any potential interference with sensitive sites.

#### Q: Can I add more allowed domains?
**A**: Currently, allowed domains are configured by the extension developers for security reasons. This prevents malicious sites from being monitored.

#### Q: Does the extension slow down my browsing?
**A**: The extension is designed for minimal performance impact. Most monitoring happens passively without affecting page load times.

#### Q: Can I use this extension in incognito mode?
**A**: The extension can work in incognito mode if you enable it in browser settings, but it will operate with the same privacy protections.

### Technical

#### Q: What happens if I uninstall the extension?
**A**: All stored data (preferences and logs) are automatically removed. No traces remain in your browser.

#### Q: Can I backup my extension settings?
**A**: Settings can be preserved by exporting audit logs, but there's no automatic sync or backup feature.

#### Q: Is the source code available for review?
**A**: Yes, the extension uses transparent, non-obfuscated code that can be reviewed for security verification.

#### Q: How often should I update the extension?
**A**: Enable automatic updates or check monthly for updates to ensure you have the latest security patches.

### Troubleshooting

#### Q: The extension icon is gray/inactive - what's wrong?
**A**: This usually means you're on a domain where the extension doesn't operate. Navigate to an allowed domain or check your permissions.

#### Q: I'm getting permission errors - how do I fix this?
**A**: Check your browser's extension settings and ensure all requested permissions are granted. You may need to re-enable the extension.

#### Q: The audit logs are empty - is the extension working?
**A**: If audit logging is disabled or you haven't visited allowed domains, logs may be empty. Enable logging and visit example.com to test.

#### Q: Can I recover deleted audit logs?
**A**: No, once audit logs are cleared, they cannot be recovered. Export logs before clearing if you need to keep them.
